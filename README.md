# Machine-Learning-Classifiers-of-Grayscale-Images-on-Fashion-MNIST-dataset

A machine learning model is developed to classify 28*28 pixels  greyscale images into ten pre-defined categories: t-shirt, trouser, pullover, dress, coat,  sandal, shirt, sneaker, bag, and ankle boot. Given the training set 30,000 examples downloaded from the Fashion-MNIST dataset, we implemented several types of machine learning model to compare and identify the most accurate and efficient model. For each model, we follow these steps: data preprocessing, model training, hyperparameter tuning, and evaluation. At the end, we compared the models based on several metrics including accuracy, f1-score, training time and inference time. In conclusion, SVM achieved the highest overall accuracy 88.64%, but had the highest inference time. Random Forest performed well on accuracy of 87.44%. Logistic Regression achieves accuracy of 85.48%. Decision tree had the fastest training time but had the lowest accuracy of 79.65%.
